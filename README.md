# Whistler-project
WhistlerMTN is an app built to help identify the best ski-runs/lifts to take for your upcoming Whistler trip. Using Scrapy, data is gathered directly from Whistlers website and WhistlerMTN suggests different areas of the resort to explore for the day.  Mountain information such as wind, weather and grooming status are compared to the riders preferences and a personalized report is generated on the users profile page.  

On the homepage, there is a real time connection to the twitter feed and youtubes live cam of Whistler Village. Users are able to rate and favorite runs, then text their favorites list using Twilio.  

Lastly, with the library ElevateZoom, users have an interactive trail map that magnifies on mouse over.  For another view of lift to ski-run connections, users have a tree map created with D3, that shows the different lift and skirun connections.
