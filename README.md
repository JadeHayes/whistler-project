# Whistler-project
For people who are new to whislter & want suggestions about where on the mountain to explore first. 
The app gathers data from whistler's website and gives users suggested areas of the mountian to ski depending on
the their riding preferences, weather conditions and the daily grooming report.  It also connects whistler's twitter feed and a live cam of the mountain.
