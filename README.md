# whistler-project
Whistler project is an app for people new to whislter and would like to know which areas to explore first.  
The app gathers data from the whistler website and gives riders suggested areas of the mountian to ski depending on
users riding preferences.  Also connects whistler's twitter feed and a live cam feed of the mountain.
