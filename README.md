# Whistler-project
This is an app for people who are new to whislter and would like to know which areas of the resort they may like to ski/ride. 
The app gathers data from the whistler website and gives riders suggested areas of the mountian to ski depending on
the users riding preferences, the weather and the grooming report.  It also connects whistler's twitter feed and a live cam feed of the mountain so users have real time mountain updates.
